This app is for the "Readable" project that is part of the Udacity React Nano-degree course.

## Get Started

Install the app dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

And then start the app up

```sh
npm start
```

## Server

By default, the app uses a copy of the provided project server hosted on `now`, but the server's base URL can easily be customized by specifying a different environment variable if needed.

For instance, to use a server instance running on `localhost:3001`:

```sh
REACT_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 npm start
```
